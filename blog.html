		<p>Welcome to the initial installment of my blog!  I will try to use this space as an accurate recording of my web development victories and fails.  Hopefully, I will be able to look back at these entries and realize just how far I was able to go in six short months.</p>
		<p>As I write this, it is Fall of 2015, and my favorite team, the New York Mets, are down 2-0 in the World Series.  Much like them, I sometimes feel like an underdog in life in general.  On the surface, I probably don't look like a typical web developer, gamer, or classically trained musician, but the cool thing about being an underdog is that you get to surprise the heck out of people pretty often.  I pray that my Mets are able to do that, but more importantly I hope that I can reach the goal that I have set for myself of finishing the Bootcamp and securing a job that I really enjoy.</p>
